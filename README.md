# Agent-based-bactieria-colony
Simulation of bacteria colony.   
 

Simulates bacterias full life cycle (growth, maturing, division, and death) as well as life activities (moving, getting hungry, eating).

In the simulation bacteria have 2 types of food, however one is more energetically efficient than the other. 

The project also includes simulation of antibiotics (causing bacteria to die) and bacteriostatics (preventing bacteria from reproducing).


In each iteration, the bacteria need to fulfill their hunger in order to try to reproduce. If they are not eating, they are moving and looking for food.
